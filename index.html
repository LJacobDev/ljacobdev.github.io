        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Thank you for taking a moment to visit my portfolio, which is currently a work in progress.</p>
        <p>This area is undergoing development and will be experiencing frequent updates over the next while.</p>

        <h2>Work in Progress on Original Apps and Demonstrations</h2>
        <p>This section points to repositories for portfolio pieces and applications that I'm working on, either to show what I know how to do, or because I want to use them to help myself solve problems.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/LJacobDev/mini-library-management-system">Demo Library App with Staff Dashboard and AI Chat Agent (Vue 3 / Nuxt 4)</a></h3>

        <p><strong>An important note about this Library app</strong> is that it was performed as an exercise in using LLMs to make a working site in the shortest time possible, so it emphasized shipping functionality quickly using timesaving measures such as only using manual testing.  Starting from absolute zero, it had tech stacks researched for fit and specifications made in 3 days, and it was built with manual testing in 3 more days.  There is a plan for testing coverage and other quality improvements to be done on this app, and its current state of being made in a rush was both intentional and not a reflection of the kind of Test Driven Development that I prefer to build my code by.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/LJacobDev/toy-robot-simulator-v2">Toy Robot Simulator</a></h3>

        <p>This project was completed as an exercise in deciding a tech stack and specifying an API endpoint, as well as focusing on the quality of code documentation and thinking about test coverage, all while building it entirely without the assistance of either code generation AI or asking AI any questions.  This was created using only documentation, or non-AI searches and Stack Overflow posts to troubleshoot issues along the way.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/LJacobDev/goal-catcher-journal">Goal Catcher Journal (coming soon)</a></h3>

        <p>Note:  This project was originally intended as an open source project, but this repo still remains as a stub to show that it exists and is under development.</p>
        
        <h2>Work Done While Following Guided Lessons</h2>
        <p>This section points to repos made while taking courses on various technologies like Vue.js. In this section, the code is from working through a guided course that was helped along by examples from the instructor, but if you see something posted on here, it means that I also fully understand the code and design behind it and can answer any questions about it.</p>
        <p>These examples are often meant for learning about specific framework features, so some important things (like error handling, unit tests, or building out more than the basic idea) aren't going to be seen as much in these examples.</p>
