Thank you for taking a moment to visit my portfolio!

I've been spending a couple of years intensively learning web development technologies, but now it is time to show what I can do.

This area is undergoing development and will be experiencing frequent updates over the next while.




## Work in progress on original apps and demonstrations

This section points to repositories for portfolio pieces and applications that I'm making either to show what I know how to do, or else am building because I want to use them to help me solve problems.

Goal Catcher Journal (coming soon)


## Work done while following guided lessons

This section points to several repos made while taking courses on various technologies like Vue.js, PHP or deploying AI-based applications.  In this section, the code might be something that was part of a guided course that was helped along by examples from the instructor, but in this case, if you see something posted on here, it means that I also fully understand the code and design behind it and can answer any questions about it.
