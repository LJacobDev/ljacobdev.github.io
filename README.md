Thank you for taking a moment to visit my portfolio!

I've been spending a couple of years intensively learning web development technologies, but now it is time to show what I can do.

This area is undergoing development and will be experiencing frequent updates over the next while.




## Work in progress on original apps and demonstrations

This section points to repositories for portfolio pieces and applications that I'm making either to show what I know how to do, or else am building because I want to use them to help me solve problems.

### [Patron-facing Library App with Staff Dashboard (Vue 3 / Nuxt 4)](https://github.com/LJacobDev/mini-library-management-system)

### [Goal Catcher Journal (coming soon)](https://github.com/LJacobDev/goal-catcher-journal)


## Work done while following guided lessons

This section points to several repos made while taking courses on various technologies like Vue.js, PHP or deploying AI-based applications.  In this section, the code might be something that was part of a guided course that was helped along by examples from the instructor, but in this case, if you see something posted on here, it means that I also fully understand the code and design behind it and can answer any questions about it.

These examples are mostly the result of learning about framework features or functionality, so some important things (like error handling, unit tests, or building out more than the basic idea) aren't going to be seen as much in these examples, but they still are here for now to show things that I have exposure to and familiarity with.

### [Examples of working with the Vue 3 Composition API](https://github.com/LJacobDev/vue-3-in-action-projects)

### [Making a Laravel-like framework from scratch in PHP](https://github.com/LJacobDev/workopia-php)

### [Making a Rocket server in Rust](https://github.com/LJacobDev/rust-rocket-web-server)

### Apps that feature AI Agents (coming soon)
