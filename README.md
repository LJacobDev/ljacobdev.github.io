Thank you for taking a moment to take a look at this!

This area is currently a landing page to help highlight and explain repositories of interest.


This is undergoing development, and will include a few specific sections.

One section will be for work in progress, where which will point to repositories of portfolio pieces and demonstrations of applications that I'm either making to show what I know how to do or else am building because I want to use them to help me solve problems.

Another section will point to repos made while taking courses on various technologies like Vue.js, PHP or deploying AI-based applications.  In this section, the code might be something that was part of a guided course and helped along by examples from the instructor, but in this case if you see something posted on here, it means that I also fully understand the code and design behind it and can answer any questions about it.
